                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Ideas of computer science were first mentioned before the 1950s
                    under the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University, where they had
                    discussed and began thinking of computer circuits and numerical calculations. As time went on, the
                    field of information technology and computer science became more complex and was able to handle the
                    processing of more data. Scholarly articles began to be published from different organizations.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying,
                    designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining
                    applications, frameworks, or other software components. Software development involves writing and
                    maintaining the source code, but in a broader sense, it includes all processes from the conception
                    of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, typically in a planned
                    and structured process. Software development also includes research, new development, prototyping,
                    modification, reuse, re-engineering, maintenance, or any other activities that result in software
                    products.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">AI applications include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google),
                    recommendation
                    systems (used by YouTube, Amazon and Netflix), understanding human speech (such as Siri and Alexa),
                    self-driving cars (e.g., Tesla), automated decision-making and competing at the highest level in
                    strategic game systems (such as chess and Go). </p>
                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                    As machines become increasingly capable, tasks
                    considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known
                    as the AI effect. For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things
                    considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.</p>
